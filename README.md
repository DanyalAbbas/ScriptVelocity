# Typing Speed Checker  

A Command-Line Interface (CLI) application designed to evaluate typing speed and accuracy. Built using the **C programming language** as part of our first-year project at **NED University (CSIT Department)**. This tool provides users with a quick and interactive way to measure their typing skills.

## Usage  

1. Run the application using the steps in the **Installation** section.  
2. A random sentence will appear on the screen for typing.  
3. Start typing the displayed text as accurately and quickly as possible.  
4. Once finished, the program will calculate and display:  
   - Typing speed in WPM.  
   - Accuracy percentage.  
   - Number of errors.

## How It Works  

1. The program stores a predefined set of sentences/paragraphs.  
2. A random sentence is displayed to the user.  
3. The timer starts when the user begins typing and stops when the user finishes.  
4. The program calculates:  
   - **Speed**: Based on the number of correctly typed words per minute.  
   - **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct characters typed compared to the total.
